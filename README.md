# Constrained Adversarial Attacks for Network Intrusion Detection

This repository contains Python code for implementing constrained adversarial attacks on black-box zeroth-order optimization attacks (ZOO) and two white-box adversarial attacks: Carlini and Wagner Attack (C&W) and DeepFool Attack. 

# Features
Datasets: We used UNSW-NB15 and IoT-23 datasets, We preprocessed and balanced both datasets to ensure a fair and accurate evaluation of our attacks.

Comparison with JSMA: Our constrained evasion attacks are compared against the Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA) presented in the "Adversarial examples for network intrusion detection systems" paper.
